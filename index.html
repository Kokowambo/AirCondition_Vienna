<h1>Café Dataset Update – Vienna’s 1st District</h1>

<p>
On hot summer days, many people seek out air-conditioned cafés to cool down and rest – especially older adults and vulnerable groups. However, in densely built urban areas like Vienna's 1st district, there's little reliable data showing which cafés even offer air conditioning. Although <strong>OpenStreetMap (OSM)</strong> includes an <code>air_conditioning</code> tag, it is rarely used in practice.
</p>

<p>
To address this gap, we analyzed 139 cafés in the 1st district and discovered that only <strong>6 entries contained AC information</strong>. The dataset also had significant gaps in other key attributes like opening hours, addresses, and websites.
</p>

<h2>Original Dataset ("Before")</h2>

<p>
The map below shows the initial state of the dataset, with most cafés lacking information on AC availability. Only 4 cafés were marked as having AC, and 2 without – while the remaining 133 had no data. This lack of information limits the usefulness of the dataset for both citizens and urban planners.

<h2>Cleaning and Completion</h2>

<p>
We manually reviewed and updated the data by searching online, checking websites, and validating locations. Cafés with outdated or unclear data were excluded. As a result, we compiled a <strong>cleaned dataset of 120 cafés</strong>, with:
<ul>
  <li><strong>69 cafés</strong> confirmed to have air conditioning (~58%)</li>
  <li><strong>43 cafés</strong> without AC (~36%)</li>
  <li><strong>8 cafés</strong> still lacking clear info (~7%)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Updated Dataset ("After")</h2>

<p>
The updated map below provides a much more reliable and complete picture. It highlights the distribution of air-conditioned cafés across the city center and offers a useful basis for climate adaptation strategies, heat mitigation planning, or simply finding a cool place to relax in summer.
