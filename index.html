    <h1>Café Dataset Update – Vienna 1st District</h1>
    <p>Visualizing air conditioning availability in cafés to support heat adaptation in urban spaces</p>
</div>

<section>
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        Everyone knows the situation: it’s over 30°C, you’re strolling through the city and decide to take a break in a café
        to cool down and escape the heat – only to realize it’s just as hot inside.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vienna’s city center – especially the 1st district – heats up significantly in summer due to dense surfaces and a lack of greenery.
        Many people – especially older adults and vulnerable groups – depend on cool places to rest and recover.
        Yet currently, no reliable dataset exists showing which cafés offer air conditioning.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our goal: Create an open, updated dataset that helps people identify and access cooled cafés in the city center.
    </p>

    <h2>Dataset Before</h2>
    <p>
        The original dataset from OpenStreetMap contained information on 139 cafés in Vienna’s 1st district.
        However, the data was incomplete:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only 6 cafés (~4%) had information about air conditioning.</li>
        <li>26% had no opening hours listed.</li>
        <li>32% had no street name.</li>
        <li>53% were missing a website.</li>
        <li>96% had no AC information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This visual shows the dataset before manual cleaning and enhancement:

    <h2>Dataset After</h2>
    <p>
        After updating and verifying each café manually, the dataset now includes 120 valid cafés.
        We removed duplicates and permanently closed locations, and added missing attributes through web search.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>69 cafés with air conditioning (~58%)</li>
        <li>43 cafés without air conditioning (~36%)</li>
        <li>8 cafés with no information (~7%)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This interactive map displays the updated dataset:

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>
        Some limitations still apply to the dataset. Despite best efforts, a few entries could not be verified or had to be excluded:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>19 cafés were removed due to duplication or closure</li>
        <li>12 values across the dataset could not be updated (8x AC info, 3x website, 1x opening hours)</li>
        <li>We successfully adjusted 287 incorrect or missing values overall</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>Use Case</h2>
    <p>
        This enriched dataset can support various applications:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenStreetMap Contribution:</strong> Reintegration of verified data helps improve OSM quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Heat Resilience:</strong> Urban planning can use the data to guide vulnerable groups to cooled spaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart City Apps:</strong> Integration into WienBot or similar platforms enables real-time user guidance.</li>
        <li><strong>Urban Analytics:</strong> The data supports spatial analysis of cooling infrastructure and social equity.</li>
    </ul>
