<h1>Café Dataset Update – Vienna’s 1st District</h1>

<p>
On hot summer days, many people – especially older adults and vulnerable groups – seek out air-conditioned cafés to cool down and rest. In Vienna’s city center, however, it’s often unclear which cafés even offer air conditioning. While <strong>OpenStreetMap (OSM)</strong> provides an <code>air_conditioning</code> tag, it is rarely used in practice.
</p>

<p>
To better understand the availability of AC in the 1st district, we analyzed a dataset of 139 cafés and found that only <strong>6 entries included air conditioning information</strong>. In addition, many cafés lacked data on other basic attributes like opening hours, street names, and websites, limiting the dataset’s utility.
</p>

<h2>Original Dataset ("Before")</h2>

<p>
The following map shows the original state of the dataset. Only 4 cafés were marked as having air conditioning and 2 as not having it, while 133 entries provided no information. This incomplete picture highlights the limitations of relying on current OSM data for public use or urban planning.

<h2>Cleaning and Completion</h2>

<p>
We manually reviewed each café by checking official websites and online sources. Entries with outdated or incorrect information were removed. After cleaning, we arrived at a refined dataset of <strong>120 valid cafés</strong>. Of these, <strong>69 were confirmed to have air conditioning</strong>, <strong>43 did not</strong>, and <strong>8 still lacked reliable information</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Updated Dataset ("After")</h2>

<p>
The updated map presents a more accurate view of the distribution of air-conditioned cafés across the district. This improved dataset can support heat adaptation strategies, inform spatial planning decisions, or simply help residents and visitors find a cool place to take a break.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>
During data cleaning, we excluded 19 cafés that were permanently closed or duplicated. This left us with 120 cafés for analysis. Despite extensive online research, we were unable to update 12 values – including 3 missing websites, 1 opening hour, and 8 unresolved air conditioning attributes.
</p>

<p>
On the positive side, we successfully adjusted <strong>287 values</strong> across all columns. This includes 131 updated air conditioning entries, 35 new or corrected opening hours, 44 revised street names, 71 updated websites, and 6 corrected café names.
</p>

<h2>Use Case</h2>

<p>
This dataset benefits multiple user groups. Residents, tourists, and especially vulnerable populations such as elderly individuals can use it to identify cool indoor locations during extreme heat events.
</p>

<p>
From a technical and societal perspective, the verified AC information can be re-integrated into OpenStreetMap, contributing to community mapping and improving POI completeness. City agencies may also use it to locate safe indoor spaces as part of public heat resilience strategies.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the data can support smart city services – such as route planners or WienBot – by helping users find air-conditioned places nearby. Lastly, it offers a valuable resource for researchers and urban analysts investigating cooling infrastructure and heat vulnerability in dense city centers.
