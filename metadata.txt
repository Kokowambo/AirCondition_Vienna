Title: Air Conditioning in Cafés – Vienna 1st District (2025)

Description:
This dataset documents cafés in Vienna’s 1st district and includes manually collected information about the presence or absence of air conditioning. It addresses a significant data gap in OpenStreetMap and aims to support heat-resilience strategies, especially for vulnerable populations seeking cool public indoor places.

Dataset Filename: NEW_CafeVienna.geojson  
Data Format: GeoJSON  
Number of Features: 139

Spatial Coverage:
- Location: Vienna, Austria – District 1 (Innere Stadt)
- Bounding Box: 16.361, 48.204, 16.382, 48.215

Temporal Coverage:
- Data collection period: 2025-06-01 to 2025-06-20

Attributes:
- name: Name of the café
- addr:street: Street name
- opening_hours: Opening hours (OSM format)
- website: Website URL
- air_conditioning: Status of air conditioning (`yes`, `no`, or empty)

Methodology:
- Queried OpenStreetMap via Overpass Turbo for all cafés within Vienna’s 1st district
- Exported data in GeoJSON format
- Missing fields (air_conditioning, street names, opening hours, websites) were manually researched and added
- Direct phone/email contact was used to verify AC availability
- Removed duplicates and closed businesses
- Visualized and analyzed via Jupyter and Folium

Tools Used:
- Overpass Turbo (OSM)
- Python (Pandas, GeoPandas, Folium)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub (collaboration and publishing)

Limitations:
- 8 cafés could not be verified regarding AC availability
- Some business information may become outdated (e.g., opening hours)
- Dataset only covers one district and is not automatically updated

Maintenance Strategy:
- The dataset is currently a one-time research product.
- However, the structure and code are designed to support updates.
- Future updates or community contributions (e.g., via GitHub pull requests) are welcome.
- The data could be re-integrated into OpenStreetMap to improve OSM coverage on indoor cooling opportunities.
- The dataset structure is designed to be scalable and can be extended to other districts in Vienna (e.g., district 2–23) using the same workflow.

Compliance:
- This metadata and dataset follow the FAIR principles:
  - **Findable**: Structured metadata, keywords, GitHub indexation
  - **Accessible**: Public repository, open license
  - **Interoperable**: Open standard (GeoJSON), clearly defined schema
  - **Reusable**: Clear licensing, detailed documentation, extensible format
