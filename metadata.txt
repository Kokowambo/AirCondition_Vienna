Title: Air Conditioning in Cafés – Vienna 1st District (2025)

Description:
This dataset provides information on all cafés in Vienna’s 1st district (Innere Stadt), enriched with manually collected data on the presence or absence of air conditioning. It addresses a critical data gap in OpenStreetMap, where only ~4% of cafés in this area had AC information. The project supports heat adaptation efforts in urban environments, especially for vulnerable populations.

Methodology:
- Base data retrieved via Overpass Turbo from OpenStreetMap using the tag "amenity=cafe" within the 1010 Vienna area.
- Data was exported as GeoJSON.
- Missing attribute values (e.g., air_conditioning, street name, opening_hours, website) were manually researched and added.
- Phone calls and website checks were used to confirm air conditioning availability.
- Duplicates and permanently closed locations were removed.
- Final data visualized using Jupyter and Folium.

Tools Used:
- Overpass Turbo (OSM)
- Python (Pandas, GeoPandas, Folium)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub for collaboration and publishing

Limitations:
- 8 cafés could not be reached or confirmed regarding air conditioning status.
- Information may become outdated as cafés change opening hours, install/remove AC, or close.
- No automated update mechanism is currently in place.

Maintenance:
- One-time research dataset.
- No regular updates planned.
- Community contributions via GitHub pull requests are welcome.

Compliance:
- This metadata follows FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).
