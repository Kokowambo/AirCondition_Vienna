# Metadata: Air Conditioning in Cafés – Vienna 1st District (2025)

## Title  
**Air Conditioning in Cafés – Vienna 1st District (2025)**

Description: Manually verified dataset and visualization of air-conditioned cafés in Vienna’s city center, based on OpenStreetMap data.
Source: OpenStreetMap
Date: 2025-06

## Description  
This dataset documents cafés in Vienna’s 1st district and includes manually collected information about the presence or absence of air conditioning. It addresses a significant data gap in OpenStreetMap and aims to support heat-resilience strategies, especially for vulnerable populations seeking cool public indoor places.

## Dataset Information

- **Dataset Filename**: `NEW_CafeVienna.geojson`  
- **Data Format**: GeoJSON  
- **Number of Features**: 120

### Spatial Coverage  
- **Location**: Vienna, Austria – District 1 (Innere Stadt)  
- **Bounding Box**: 16.361, 48.204, 16.382, 48.215

### Temporal Coverage  
- **Data Collection Period**: 2025-06-01 to 2025-06-20

---

## Attributes

Each feature (café) contains the following fields:

- `name`: Name of the café  
- `addr:street`: Street name  
- `addr:housenumber`: House number  
- `addr:city`: City  
- `opening_hours`: Opening hours (OSM format)  
- `website`: Website URL  
- `air_conditioning`: Whether AC is available (`yes`, `no`, or empty)  
- `source:ac`: Method of AC verification (`manual`, `web`, `phone`)  
- `geometry`: WGS84 coordinates

---

## Methodology

- Queried OpenStreetMap via Overpass Turbo for all cafés in Vienna’s 1st district  
- Exported data in GeoJSON format  
- All cafés were either called, researched online, or visited in person to verify air conditioning availability  
- Missing fields (AC, opening hours, websites, street names, etc.) were manually added  
- Removed permanently closed or duplicate entries  
- Dataset was cleaned and validated for geometry and attribute structure  
- Visualized and analyzed using Jupyter Notebook and Folium (Python)

---

## Statistics

- Initial dataset: 139 cafés  
- Removed (closed or duplicate): 19  
- Final dataset: 120 cafés  
- With AC: 69  
- Without AC: 43  
- Unknown AC status: 8  
- Missing values unresolved: 12  
- Total values manually edited or removed: 287  
  - `air_conditioning`: 131  
  - `opening_hours`: 35  
  - `addr:street`: 44  
  - `website`: 71  
  - `name`: 6

---

## Limitations

- 8 cafés could not be verified regarding AC availability  
- Some business information (e.g. websites, opening hours) may become outdated  
- Dataset only covers Vienna’s 1st district and is not automatically updated

---

## Maintenance Strategy

- The dataset is a one-time student project, but designed for reusability  
- The structure and scripts (Jupyter/Python) are reusable for future updates or expansion  
- Community contributions are welcome via GitHub (pull requests)  
- The dataset could be re-integrated into OpenStreetMap to enrich POI data (AC, website, hours, etc.)  
- The structure is scalable and supports expansion to all 23 districts of Vienna using the same method

## Compliance with FAIR Principles

- **Findable**: Structured metadata, keywords, public GitHub indexation  
- **Accessible**: Public repository, open licenses  
- **Interoperable**: Open standard (GeoJSON), OSM-style schema  
- **Reusable**: Clear licensing (ODbL, CC BY 4.0, MIT), documentation, extensibility
